              <h4>How does it work?</h4>
              <p>
                It's easy.<br><br>

                <b>What should I do first?</b><br>
                First, you choose a book you want.<br><br>

                <b>Found one- now what?</b><br>

                Just click on the button "get the book" and an automated email will be sent in your behalf to the book owner
                The book owner will contact you back â€“ straight to your email and you can proceed from there, arrange to meet or he will sent you the book- your choice.<br><br>

                <b>How much does it cost?</b><br>
                NOTHING- the BookSwap is completely FREE<br><br>

                <b>Why?</b><br>
                So as many people can make the most of their books and reach books around the world.<br><br>

                <b>Wow sounds amazing! How can I contribute to BookSwap?</b><br>

                Glad you asked ðŸ˜Š In order to make BookSwap possible and valuable we need as many books to be shared on this platform so please- add some books you donâ€™t read anymore and share the idea and the website with your friends.
